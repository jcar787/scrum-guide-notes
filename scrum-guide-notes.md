# Scrum Guide Notes

- Definition of scrum - a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value

- Scrum is lightweight, simple to understand and difficult to master.

- Scrum is a framework within you can employ various processes and techniques to continuously improving the product, the team and the working environment.

- Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams, their roles, events, artifacts and rules.

- The rules of scrum bind together the rules, events and artifacts, governing the relationships and interaction between them.

### Uses of Scrum
- Research and identify viable markets, technologies and product capabilities
- Develop product and enhancements
- Release products and enhancements, as frequently as many times per day
- Develop and sustain cloud and other operational environments for product use
- Sustain and renew products

> Scrum proved especially effective in iterative and incremental knowledge transfer.

- The essence of scrum is a small team of people. The individual team is highly flexible and adaptive.
- These strengths continue operating in single, several, many and networks of teams that develop, release, operate and sustain the work.

### Scrum Theory
- Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.

- Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: **transparency**, **inspection** and **adaptation**.

##### Transparency
- Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.

##### Inspection
- Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect undesirable variances. The inspection should not be so frequent.


##### Adaptation
- If an inspector determines one or more aspects of a process deviates outside acceptable limits, and the result is unacceptable the process must be adjusted. This adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.

##### Four formal events for inspection and adaptation
1. Sprint Planning
2. Daily Scrum
3. Sprint Review
4. Sprint Retrospective

### Scrum Values
- Commitment
- Courage
- Focus
- Openness
- Respect

### The Scrum Team
- Consists of **Product Owner**, **Development Team**, and **Scrum Master**
- Scrum teams are self organizing and cross-functional and chose best on how to accomplish
their work, rather than being directed by outsiders.
- The mode is designed to optimize **flexibility**, **creativity** and **productivity**
- Scrum Teams develiver prodcuts iteratively and incrementally.
- Incremental deliveries of *"Done"* product ensure a potentially useful version of working
product is always available.

#### The Product Owner
- The product owner is responsible for maximizing value of the product
- The product owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog.
- Product Backlog includes
- - Clearly expressing Product Backlog items
- - Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions
- - Ensuring thaht the Product Backlog is visible, transparent and clear to all
- - Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog
- Product Owner is one person not a committee
- For the Product Owner to succeed the entire organization must respect his or her decisions.
- No one can force the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements.
