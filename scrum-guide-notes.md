# Scrum Guide Notes

- Definition of scrum - a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value

- Scrum is lightweight, simple to understand and difficult to master.

- Scrum is a framework within you can employ various processes and techniques to continuously improving the product, the team and the working environment.

- Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams, their roles, events, artifacts and rules.

- The rules of scrum bind together the rules, events and artifacts, governing the relationships and interaction between them.

## Uses of Scrum
- Research and identify viable markets, technologies and product capabilities
- Develop product and enhancements
- Release products and enhancements, as frequently as many times per day
- Develop and sustain cloud and other operational environments for product use
- Sustain and renew products

> Scrum proved especially effective in iterative and incremental knowledge transfer.

- The essence of scrum is a small team of people. The individual team is highly flexible and adaptive.
- These strengths continue operating in single, several, many and networks of teams that develop, release, operate and sustain the work.

## Scrum Theory
- Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.

- Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: **transparency**, **inspection** and **adaptation**.

#### Transparency
- Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.

#### Inspection
- Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect undesirable variances. The inspection should not be so frequent.


#### Adaptation
- If an inspector determines one or more aspects of a process deviates outside acceptable limits, and the result is unacceptable the process must be adjusted. This adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.

#### Four formal events for inspection and adaptation
1. Sprint Planning
2. Daily Scrum
3. Sprint Review
4. Sprint Retrospective

## Scrum Values
- Commitment
- Courage
- Focus
- Openness
- Respect

## The Scrum Team
- Consists of **Product Owner**, **Development Team**, and **Scrum Master**
- Scrum teams are self organizing and cross-functional and chose best on how to accomplish
their work, rather than being directed by outsiders.
- The mode is designed to optimize **flexibility**, **creativity** and **productivity**
- Scrum Teams develiver prodcuts iteratively and incrementally.
- Incremental deliveries of *"Done"* product ensure a potentially useful version of working
product is always available.

### The Product Owner
- The product owner is responsible for maximizing value of the product
- The product owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog.
- Product Backlog includes
  - Clearly expressing Product Backlog items
  - Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions
  - Ensuring thaht the Product Backlog is visible, transparent and clear to all
  - Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog
- Product Owner is one person not a committee
- For the Product Owner to succeed the entire organization must respect his or her decisions.
- No one can force the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements.

### The Development Team
- The development team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering
a potentially product at the end of each Sprint.
- Development Teams are structured and empowered to organize and manage their own work, creating
a sinergy that optimizes the overall efficiency and effectiveness.
- Characteristics:
  - Self organizing. No one tells the Development Team how to turn the Product Backlog into 
  Increments
  - Development Teams are cross-functional, with all the skills as a team necessary to create a 
  product Increment.
  - Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members, regardless of the work being 
  performed
  - Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in Development Team, regardless of domains that need to be
  addressed like testing, architecture, operations, etc
  - Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but
  accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole.

##### Development Team Size
- Optimal Development Team size is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete
significant work within a Sprint
- Less than three members decrease interaction and small productivity gains
- More than nine members requires too much coordination.
- Large Development Teams generate too much complexity for an empirical process to be useful.
- The Product Owner and Scrum Master roles are not included in this count unless they are also
executing the work of the Sprint Backlog

### The Scrum Master
