# Scrum Guide Notes

- Definition of scrum - a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value

- Scrum is lightweight, simple to understand and difficult to master.

- Scrum is a framework within you can employ various processes and techniques to continuously improving the product, the team and the working environment.

- Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams, their roles, events, artifacts and rules.

- The rules of scrum bind together the rules, events and artifacts, governing the relationships and interaction between them.

## Uses of Scrum
- Research and identify viable markets, technologies and product capabilities
- Develop product and enhancements
- Release products and enhancements, as frequently as many times per day
- Develop and sustain cloud and other operational environments for product use
- Sustain and renew products

> Scrum proved especially effective in iterative and incremental knowledge transfer.

- The essence of scrum is a small team of people. The individual team is highly flexible and adaptive.
- These strengths continue operating in single, several, many and networks of teams that develop, release, operate and sustain the work.

## Scrum Theory
- Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.

- Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: **transparency**, **inspection** and **adaptation**.

#### Transparency
- Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.

#### Inspection
- Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect undesirable variances. The inspection should not be so frequent.


#### Adaptation
- If an inspector determines one or more aspects of a process deviates outside acceptable limits, and the result is unacceptable the process must be adjusted. This adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.

#### Four formal events for inspection and adaptation
1. Sprint Planning
2. Daily Scrum
3. Sprint Review
4. Sprint Retrospective

## Scrum Values
- Commitment
- Courage
- Focus
- Openness
- Respect

## The Scrum Team
- Consists of **Product Owner**, **Development Team**, and **Scrum Master**
- Scrum teams are self organizing and cross-functional and chose best on how to accomplish
their work, rather than being directed by outsiders.
- The mode is designed to optimize **flexibility**, **creativity** and **productivity**
- Scrum Teams develiver prodcuts iteratively and incrementally.
- Incremental deliveries of *"Done"* product ensure a potentially useful version of working
product is always available.

### The Product Owner
- The product owner is responsible for maximizing value of the product
- The product owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog.
- Product Backlog includes
  - Clearly expressing Product Backlog items
  - Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions
  - Ensuring thaht the Product Backlog is visible, transparent and clear to all
  - Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog
- Product Owner is one person not a committee
- For the Product Owner to succeed the entire organization must respect his or her decisions.
- No one can force the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements.

### The Development Team
- The development team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering
a potentially product at the end of each Sprint.
- Development Teams are structured and empowered to organize and manage their own work, creating
a sinergy that optimizes the overall efficiency and effectiveness.
- Characteristics:
  - Self organizing. No one tells the Development Team how to turn the Product Backlog into 
  Increments
  - Development Teams are cross-functional, with all the skills as a team necessary to create a 
  product Increment.
  - Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members, regardless of the work being 
  performed
  - Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in Development Team, regardless of domains that need to be
  addressed like testing, architecture, operations, etc
  - Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but
  accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole.

##### Development Team Size
- Optimal Development Team size is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete
significant work within a Sprint
- Less than three members decrease interaction and small productivity gains
- More than nine members requires too much coordination.
- Large Development Teams generate too much complexity for an empirical process to be useful.
- The Product Owner and Scrum Master roles are not included in this count unless they are also
executing the work of the Sprint Backlog

### The Scrum Master
- The Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum.
- The Scrum Master helps everyone to understand Scrum theory, practices, rules and values
- The Scrum Master helps those outside the Scrum Team to understand the interactions to maximize
the value

#### Scrum Master Service to the Product Owner
- Ensuring that goals, scope and product domain are understood by everyone
- Finding techniques for effective Product backlog management
- Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items
- Understanding product planning in an empirical environment
- Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog
- Understanding and practicing agility
- Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed

#### Scrum Master Service to the Development Team
- Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality
- Helping the Development Team to create high-value products
- Removing impediments to the Development Team
- Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed
- Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet
adopted and understood

#### Scrum Master Service to the Organization
- Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption
- Planning Scrum implementations within the organization
- Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development
- Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team
- Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum in
the organization

### Scrum Events
- Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regularity and minimize the need for meetings
- All events are timed events, such that every event has a maximum duration
- Once a Sprint begins it's duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened
- All other events except for Sprint is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt something
- These events are designed to enable critical transparency and inspection
- Failure to include these events results in reduced transparency

#### The Sprint
- Sprint is the heart of the Scrum, a time-box of one month or less, which a Done, useable,
releasable product Increment is created.
- Sprints have consistent durations.
- A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint
- Sprint consist of **Sprint Planning**, **Daily Scrums**, **development work**, 
**Sprint Review** and **Sprint Retrospective**
- During the Sprint
  - No changes are made that would endager the Sprint Goal
  - Quality goals do not decrease
  - Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development team
- Each Sprint has a goal of what is to be built, a design and flexible plan that will guide 
building it, the work and the resultant product increment.
- Sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a 
Sprint Goal

##### Cancelling a Sprint
- A Sprint can be cancelled only by the Product Owner
- A Sprint would be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete
- When a Sprint is cancelled, any completed and "Done" Product Backlog items are reviewed.
- If part of the work is releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it
- All incomplete Product Backlog Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product backlog
- Sprint cancellations consume resources, since everyone regroups in another Sprint Planning 
to start another Sprint.
- Sprint cancellations are very uncommon.

### Sprint Planning
- Plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team
- Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one month Sprint.
- Sprint Planning answers the following
  - What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
  - How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

#### Topic One: What can be done this Sprint?
- The Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the
Sprint
- The Product Owner discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the Product
Backlog items that would achieve the Sprint Goal.
- The entire Scrum Team collaborates on understanding the work of the Sprint
- The input of this meeting is the Product Backlog, the latest product Increment, projected
capacity of the Development Team during the Sprint and the past performance of the Development
Team
- Only the Development Team can assess what it can accomplish over the upcoming Sprint
- During Sprint Planning the Scrum Team also crafts a Sprint Goal, which is an objective that
will be met within the Sprint.

#### Topic Two: How will the chosen work get done?
- The Development Team decides how it will build the functionality into a Done Product increment.
- The Development Team self-organizes to undertake the work in the Sprint Backlog
- The Product Owner can help to clarify the selected Product Backlog items and make trade-offs.
- The Development Team may also invite other people to attend to provide technical advice.
- By the end of the Sprint Planning the Development Team should be able to explain how it 
intends to self-organize to accomplish the Sprint Goal.

#### Sprint Goal
- The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation
of Product Backlog.
- Provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment
- It gives the Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented
- If the work turns out to be different than the Development Team expected, they collaborate
with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.

### Daily Scrum
- The Daily Scrum is a 15 minute time-boxed for the Development Team.
- The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint.
- The Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours
- The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity
- The Development Team uses the Daily Scrum to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and
inspect how progress is trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog
- The Daily Scrum optimizes the probability that the Development Team will meet the Sprint Goal.
- The three questions that should be answered in the Daily Scrum are:
  - What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
  - What will I do today to help the Development Team meets the Sprint Goal?
  - DO I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint 
  Goal?
- The Development Team often meet immediately after the Daily Scrum for detailed discussions
or to adapt or replan the rest of the Sprint's work
- The Scrum Master ensures that the Development Team has the meeting, but the Development Team
is responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum
- The Scrum Master teaches the Development Team to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15 minute 
time-box
- The Daily Scrum is an internal meeting for the Development Team. If others are present, the
Scrum Master ensures that they do not disrupt the meeting.
- Daily Scrums improve communications, eliminate other meetings, identify impediments to 
development for removal, highlight and promote quick decision-making and improve the Development
Team's level of knowledge

### Sprint Review
- A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the
Product Backlog if needed.
- This is an informal meeting, the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback
and foster collaboration
- This is at most a four-hour meeting for one-month Sprints, for shorter Sprints is shorter
- The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendees understand its purpose
- The Scrum Master teaches everyone involved to keep it withing the time box
- The Sprint Review includes the following elements:
  - Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner
  - The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into
  and how those problems were solved
  - The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has "Done" and answers questions about
  the Increment
  - The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely
  target and delivery dates based on progress to date
  - The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides 
  valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning
  - Review of how tha marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is
  the most valuable thing to do next
  - Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities and marketplace for the next 
  anticipated releases of functionality or capability of the product
- The result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product
Backlog items for the next Sprints.
